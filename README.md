# SlimeVR Server
Server app for SlimeVR ecosystem

Server orchestrates communication between multiple sensors and integrations, like SteamVR.

Sensors implementations:
* [SlimeVR Tracker for ESP](https://github.com/SlimeVR/SlimeVR-Tracker-ESP) - ESP microcontrollers and multiple IMUs are supported
* [owoTrack Mobile App](https://github.com/abb128/owoTrackVRSyncMobile) - use phones as trackers (limited functionality and compatibility)
* [SlimeVR Wrangler](https://github.com/carl-anders/slimevr-wrangler) - use Nintendo Switch Joycon controllers as trackers

Integrations:
* Use [SlimeVR OpenVR Driver](https://github.com/SlimeVR/SlimeVR-OpenVR-Driver) as a driver for SteamVR.
* Use built-in OSC Trackers support for FBT integration with VRChat, PCVR or Standalone.
* Use built-in VMC support for sending and receiving tracking data to and from other apps such as VSeeFace.
* Export recordings as .BVH files to integrate motion capture data into 3d applications such as Blender.

## License clarification
**SlimeVR software** (including server, firmware, drivers, installer, documents, and others - see
licence for each case specifically) **is distributed under a dual MIT/Apache 2.0 License
([LICENSE-MIT] and [LICENSE-APACHE]). The software is the copyright of the SlimeVR
contributors.**

**However, these licenses have some limits, and if you wish to distribute software based
on SlimeVR, you need to be aware of them:**

* When distributing any software that uses or is based on SlimeVR, you have to provide
  to the end-user at least one of the original, unmodified [LICENSE-MIT] or
  [LICENSE-APACHE] files from SlimeVR. This includes the `Copyright (c) 2020 Eiren Rain
  and SlimeVR Contributors` part of the license. It is insufficient to use a generic MIT
  or Apache-2.0 License, **it must be the original license file**.
* This applies even if you distribute software without the source code. In this case,
  one way to provide it to the end-user is to have a menu in your application that lists
  all the open source licenses used, including SlimeVR's.

Please refer to the [LICENSE-MIT] and [LICENSE-APACHE] files if you are at any point
uncertain what the exact requirements are.
