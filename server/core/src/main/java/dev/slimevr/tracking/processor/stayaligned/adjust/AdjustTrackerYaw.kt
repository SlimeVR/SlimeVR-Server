	/**
	 * Adjusts the yaw of a tracker.
	 *
	 * Locked Trackers
	 * ---------------
	 * After a tracker is at rest for a short time, we lock it and save its initial
	 * rotation. We assume that locked trackers really are at rest, and that any
	 * rotation is due to drift. We adjust the tracker's yaw towards its initial
	 * rotation. If the tracker rotates beyonds a certain angle, we unlock the
	 * tracker.
	 *
	 * This works very well when the player is still and the tracker is supported by
	 * some surface, e.g. sitting in a chair or lying in a bed. However, it does not
	 * work well when the player is standing or moving around because the trackers
	 * will never lock.
	 *
	 * Centering Force
	 * ---------------
	 * When the player is moving around, we assume that the player will often be in
	 * a relaxed pose, or will eventually return to a relaxed pose. During setup, we
	 * collect the player's relaxed posed when standing, sitting and lying on their
	 * back.
	 *
	 * The centering force adjusts the tracker's yaw towards the relaxed pose.
	 * Upper body trackers are adjusted towards the average yaw of the body. Leg
	 * trackers are also adjusted towards the average yaw of the body, but with a
	 * yaw offset corresponding to their relaxed pose.
	 *
	 * This works well when the player is moving a lot. However, it doesn't work
	 * well when some of the trackers are locked, and others are moving. The locked
	 * trackers will stay in place, while the moving trackers will pull towards the
	 * relaxed pose, which can result in imbalanced poses.
	 *
	 * Neighbor Trackers
	 * -----------------
	 * The neighboring force adjusts the tracker's yaw so that it is balanced
	 * between its neighboring trackers. For example, if the player is standing in a
	 * very wide stance, the neighboring force will push the upper leg tracker to a
	 * position that is proportional to their relaxed pose. This keeps the poses
	 * balanced.
	 *
	 * We use gradient descent to find the direction to apply a yaw correction. By
	 * applying this 50 times a second, the whole body is nudged into a reasonable
	 * alignment.
