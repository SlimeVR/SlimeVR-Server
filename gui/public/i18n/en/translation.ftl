    You need to be standing for this (i-pose). There is a 3 seconds delay (configurable) before it actually happens.

# Cares about multiline
onboarding-reset_tutorial-2 = Tap { $taps } times the highlighted tracker for triggering mounting reset.

    Mounting reset helps on how the trackers are actually put on you, so if you accidentally moved them and changed how they are oriented by a big amount, this will help.
